# SWAPPABLE: Honeypot Checker, BNB Staking Pool, and Token Pump & Dump Trader

Welcome to the Swappable project! This decentralized application (DApp) is a versatile platform that combines a Honeypot Checker, a BNB Staking Pool utilizing the Ponzi scheme mechanism for profit, and a Token Pump & Dump Trader. The project is written in Solidity for smart contracts,html and javascript for frontend, and Node.js for the backend.

## Features

### Honeypot Checker
- **Token Security Analysis:** Perform a security check on tokens to identify potential honeypot characteristics, helping users make informed decisions before investing.

### BNB Staking Pool
- **Ponzi Scheme Mechanism:** Engage in a dynamic staking experience where participants can stake BNB tokens, and earlier participants receive rewards from the contributions of newer participants, creating a profit mechanism.

### Token Pump & Dump Trader
- **Automated Trading:** Trade tokens based on pump and dump strategies, automating the buying and selling process for potential profit during market fluctuations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the DeFi Playground, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thankgod20/Swappabe.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Swappabe
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts:**
   Deploy the Solidity smart contracts to the Ethereum blockchain using tools like Remix or Truffle.

5. **Run the DApp:**
   Start the server to launch the DeFi Playground DApp.
   ```bash
   ./Swappabe/publicPhp/bsc/index.html
   ```

## Smart Contracts

The `contracts/` directory contains the Solidity smart contracts responsible for the BNB Staking Pool functionality. Ensure proper testing and auditing before deploying these contracts to the Ethereum mainnet.
